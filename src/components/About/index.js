            Hello, there. My name is Stephany (she/her) and I am a Brazilian Software Engineer, more specifically located in the city of SÃ£o Paulo.
            I graduated in the first semester of 2016 at FATEC Rubens Lara and have been collecting professional experience since then.

            I am passionate about coding and am always studying in order to learn something new and find ways to improve my skills.
            My goal is to broaden my possibilities as a professional and to challenge myself into looking for the smartest solutions.
            I just love learning and am widely open to every opportunity to evolve both technically and personally.

            Diversity and inclusion are topics that hold my interest and I value initiatives with the goal to decrease the current inequality in tech.
